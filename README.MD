## Overview

This is a quick study project built with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and the minimalist backend framework **Feastify**. The goal was to experiment with building a **minimal API** as fast as possible, using just a **single file (`server.ts`)**, without any folder structure or complex setup.

It serves as an exploration into rapid backend prototyping with TypeScript.

## Features

* Extremely minimal and fast to build
* Built using [Feastify](https://github.com/feastjs/feastify)
* Entire application contained in a single `server.ts` file
* TypeScript support for a safer coding experience

---

## Technologies Used

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Feastify](https://github.com/feastjs/feastify)

## How to Use?

1. **Clone the repository**
   `git clone https://github.com/MatheusGonzzaga/fastify-node-ts-formula-one-api.git`

2. **Install the dependencies**
   `npm install`

3. **Start the server**
   `npm run start:dev` or `npm run start:watch`

---

## Why This Approach?

The purpose of this project was to explore **how quickly and simply** an API can be built using modern tooling like **Feastify**, while still leveraging TypeScript. It strips away architecture, folders, and abstractions to focus on **speed of development** and **clarity**.
